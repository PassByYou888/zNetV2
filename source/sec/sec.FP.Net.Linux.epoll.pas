unit sec.FP.Net.Linux.epoll;

{ *
  * Linux.epoll – Pascal translation of the Linux epoll system calls.
  *
  * This unit provides constants and function prototypes for epoll_create,
  * epoll_ctl, and epoll_wait, as well as the eventfd function for waking
  * up epoll_wait. It is used by the epoll CrossSocket implementation.
  *
  * The definitions are based on the Linux man pages and the C header files.
  * For Delphi (non‑FPC) on Linux, the functions are linked directly.
