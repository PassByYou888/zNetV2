  *  Large Data Templet for HPC – Scalable Three-Tier Hierarchical Database
  *
  *  This unit provides a production-ready, high-performance storage system for
  *  managing data across three distinct size categories: Small, Medium, and Large.
  *  It is built directly on top of Z.ZDB2.Thread and Z.ZDB2.Thread.LiteData,
  *  extending them with a type‑aware, relational‑like model that is ideal for
  *  applications such as face recognition, surveillance, AI training pipelines,
  *  video archives, and any large‑scale data‑intensive system.
  *
  *  Architecture Overview
  *  ---------------------
  *  The system is organized into three independent database pools, each designed
  *  for a specific data size and access pattern:
  *
  *    1. Small Data (S_DB)   – ~1 KB blocks, up to 1.5 TB per library.
  *       Script aliases: 'Small', 'Tiny', 'Little', 'S', 'Lv1', '1'.
  *       Optimized for logs, device status, JSON/XML/INI configurations, DFE
  *       serialized objects, and other lightweight records. Supports full
  *       traversal and high‑speed indexing via Sequence_ID.
  *
  *    2. Medium Data (M_DB)  – ~8 KB blocks, up to 15 TB per library.
  *       Script aliases: 'Default', 'Medium', 'Middle', 'M', 'Lv2', '2'.
  *       Optimized for images, PDFs, office documents, source code, and small
  *       binary files. Uses block‑level pre‑reading to extract Sequence_IDs
  *       without loading the entire data body.
  *
  *    3. Large Data (L_DB)   – ~64 KB blocks, up to 100 TB per library.
  *       Script aliases: 'Large', 'Big', 'Huge', 'L', 'Lv3', '3'.
  *       Optimized for videos, compressed archives, AI datasets, and large
  *       binary blobs. Recommended to split huge files (e.g., 500 MB video) into
  *       segments and reference them via Small‑Data Sequence_IDs.
  *
  *  Each stored record is assigned a unique 64‑bit Sequence_ID (auto‑incremented
  *  per category) and an MD5 checksum of its payload. Both are stored in a fixed
  *  24‑byte header prepended to the data body (8 bytes for Sequence_ID,
  *  16 bytes for MD5). This header is present in the on‑disk representation and
  *  is used for fast reverse lookup via the corresponding Sequence_ID pool.
  *
  *  Loading Modes (Data Extraction)
  *  --------------------------------
  *  All three databases support multiple loading strategies, allowing trade‑offs
  *  between speed, memory, and I/O granularity:
  *
  *    – Full Load   (Extract_*_Full)     : Reads and decodes every data object
  *      entirely in parallel. Suitable for small databases or when full content
  *      is needed immediately.
  *
  *    – Block Load  (Extract_*_Block)    : Reads only a specific block index,
  *      offset, and size from each object. Ideal for partial content retrieval
  *      (e.g., reading a single frame from a video segment).
  *
  *    – Position Load (Extract_*_Position): Reads a contiguous byte range from
  *      each object. Used for range‑based queries.
  *
  *    – Accelerated Header Load (External Header Optimization):
  *      If the corresponding flag (S_DB_Engine_External_Header_Optimzied_Technology,
  *      etc.) is enabled, the system stores a compact external header block
  *      during flush. This block contains Sequence_ID and MD5 for every record
  *      in the pool. On startup, the system first attempts to restore all
  *      Sequence_IDs from this header (Extract_External_Header) – which is much
  *      faster than reading the full data – and falls back to full/block/position
  *      load only if the header is missing or corrupted.
  *
  *  Data Flow and Lifecycle
  *  -----------------------
  *  1. Creation: A new data item is created via Create_Small_Data, Create_Medium_Data,
  *     or Create_Large_Data. A fresh Sequence_ID is allocated, and the instance
  *     is added to the engine pool and the corresponding Sequence_ID pool.
  *
  *  2. Encoding: When posting (Post_Data_To_*_DB), the payload is encoded via
  *     Encode_To_ZDB2_Data, which prepends Sequence_ID and MD5. The encoded
  *     buffer is then asynchronously written to the underlying ZDB2 storage.
  *
  *  3. Flush: During a flush operation, the marshal calls Prepare_Flush_External_Header,
  *     which serializes Sequence_ID and MD5 for all active instances into the
  *     external header block (if optimization is enabled). The header is stored
  *     in the database’s custom header area.
  *
  *  4. Rebuild: After loading (full/block/position), the Rebuild_*_DB_Sequence
  *     methods sort all data by Sequence_ID and rebuild the reverse‑lookup
  *     pools, ensuring that the Sequence_ID pools reflect the current data.
  *
  *  5. Batch Posting: The TZDB2_Custom_Batch_Data_Post_Bridge allows multiple
  *     related records (e.g., a JSON small record referencing several medium and
  *     large blobs) to be posted atomically. The bridge tracks success/failure
  *     and can automatically roll back the entire batch if any error occurs.
  *
  *  6. Modification: Existing data can be replaced using Modify_*_DB_Data, which
  *     updates the payload, recomputes the MD5, and re‑encodes the data.
  *
  *  Script-Driven Configuration
  *  ---------------------------
  *  The TZDB2_Large class can be built from a TTextDataEngine script that defines
  *  one section per engine. Each section specifies the database file, block size,
  *  cipher settings, and a 'Type' field that selects Small/Medium/Large. The
  *  Build_DB_From_Script method creates the appropriate engine and attaches it to
  *  the corresponding marshal. The Make_Script helper generates a ready‑to‑use
  *  script with configurable numbers of sub‑engines for each size category.
  *
  *  Backup, Flush, and Statistics
  *  -----------------------------
  *  – Backup: Backup(Reserve_) creates a point‑in‑time copy of each sub‑engine,
  *    keeping up to Reserve_ historical versions.
  *
  *  – Flush: Flush(WaitQueue_) forces all pending asynchronous writes to disk.
  *    If WaitQueue_ is True, the call blocks until the command queue is empty.
  *
  *  – Statistics: Database_Size, Database_Physics_Size, Total, QueueNum, and
  *    fragment buffer metrics are available for monitoring and capacity planning.
  *
  *  Thread Safety and Performance
  *  -----------------------------
  *  All public methods are thread‑safe thanks to critical sections and atomic
  *  counters. The system is designed for high concurrency: read operations are
  *  lock‑free when using pools, and writes are enqueued as commands to the
  *  underlying TZDB2_Th_Queue instances. The external header optimization
  *  dramatically reduces startup latency on HDDs by minimizing random I/O.
  *
  *  This unit is a cornerstone for building large‑scale, high‑performance
  *  data‑intensive applications in the Z‑Series ecosystem.
