{ ******************************************************************************
  * Z.LinearAction - Linear Action Execution Engine
  *
  * This unit provides a hierarchical, state-driven framework for executing
  * sequences of actions in a linear (sequential) manner. It is designed for
  * game logic, animation sequences, story flow control, and any scenario
  * requiring ordered execution of discrete steps.
  *
  * Architecture (Three-Layer Structure):
  *   1. TLAction (Base Action):
  *      The fundamental unit of execution. Each action has a lifecycle
  *      (Run ¡ú Progress ¡ú Over/Stop) and maintains its own execution state.
  *      Custom actions are created by subclassing TLAction and overriding
  *      the Progress method.
  *
  *   2. TLActionList (Action Sequence):
  *      Manages a linear list of TLAction instances. Actions are executed
  *      sequentially: when one action completes (Over), the next action
  *      in the list begins. A TCadencer timer drives the progress of the
  *      currently active action.
  *
  *   3. TLAction_Linear (Linear Executor):
  *      The top-level container that manages a sequence of TLActionList
  *      instances. It provides an additional level of nesting, allowing
  *      complex scripts to be composed of multiple action lists executed
  *      in order.
  *
  * State Machine:
  *   Each action goes through the following states:
  *     - asPlaying: The action is actively executing.
  *     - asPause:   The action is paused (still in asPlaying, but not
  *                  progressing).
  *     - asStop:    The action has been forcibly terminated.
  *     - asOver:    The action has completed normally.
  *
  * Usage:
  *   1. Subclass TLAction to implement custom behavior.
  *   2. Create a TLActionList and add actions using the Add method.
  *   3. Call Run() to start the sequence.
  *   4. Call Progress(deltaTime) repeatedly to advance execution.
  *   5. Use Over() to signal normal completion, or Stop() to abort.
  *
  * The framework also supports automatic timing via TCadencer when the
  * parameterless Progress() method is called.

    TLAction is the abstract base class for all actions in the linear action
    framework. It defines the lifecycle methods and state management for a
    single executable unit.

    To create a custom action, subclass TLAction and override the Progress
    method. The Run, Over, Stop, and Pause methods can also be overridden
    to implement custom state transition logic.

    The action maintains its own State set, which is used by the parent
    TLActionList to determine when to advance to the next action.

      Starts the action. This method is called by the parent TLActionList
      when the action becomes active. The default implementation sets the
      state to asPlaying.
    }
    procedure Run(); virtual;

    {
      Signals that the action has completed normally. This method is called
      by the action itself when its work is done. The default implementation
      transitions from asPlaying to asOver.
    }
    procedure Over(); virtual;

    {
      Alias for Over(). Marks the action as completed.
    }
    procedure Done();

    {
      Stops the action prematurely. This method can be called by external
      code to abort the action. The default implementation transitions
      from asPlaying to asStop.

      Updates the action's internal state. This method is called repeatedly
      by the parent TLActionList with the elapsed time delta. Subclasses
      should override this method to implement their core logic.

    Each TLActionList can optionally be owned by a TLAction_Linear, which
    allows multiple lists to be chained together.

    The list is driven by a TCadencer timer, which can be used to call
    Progress automatically, or Progress can be called manually with a
    deltaTime parameter.
