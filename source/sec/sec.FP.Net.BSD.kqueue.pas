unit sec.FP.Net.BSD.kqueue;

{ *
  * BSD.kqueue – Pascal translation of the BSD kqueue system calls.
  *
  * This unit defines the kqueue(), kevent() functions, the kevent structure,
  * and the event flags (EVFILT_READ, EVFILT_WRITE, EV_ADD, EV_DELETE, etc.)
  * used on BSD systems (including macOS, iOS, FreeBSD, etc.).
  *
  * The unit provides a helper procedure EV_SET to initialise a kevent record.
  *
  * Example:
  *   var
  *     kq: Integer;
  *     ev: TKEvent;
  *   begin
  *     kq := kqueue;
  *     EV_SET(@ev, fd, EVFILT_READ, EV_ADD or EV_ONESHOT, 0, 0, nil);
  *     kevent(kq, @ev, 1, nil, 0, nil);
  *   end;
