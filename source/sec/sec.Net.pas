  * Z.Net - High-performance, cross-platform network communication framework
  *
  * ============================================================================
  * DEPENDENCIES (uses clause)
  * ============================================================================
  * This unit relies on the following core libraries from the Z framework:
  *
  *   Z.Core                                      - base object model, threading primitives
  *   Z.PascalStrings, Z.UPascalStrings           - string types and manipulation
  *   Z.HashList.Templet                          - generic hash/list templates
  *   Z.ListEngine                                - advanced list containers
  *   Z.UnicodeMixedLib                           - mixed-encoding string helpers

  *   Z.Notify                                    - notification / callback infrastructure
  *   Z.Cadencer                                  - time-based event scheduler
  *   Z.ZDB2                                      - ZDB2 database engine (used for swap space)
  *
  * ============================================================================
  * KEY FUNCTIONALITY
  * ============================================================================
  * This unit provides a complete, scalable, and secure networking stack suitable
  * for client-server and peer-to-peer applications. It supports multiple data
  * carriers and is optimised for high throughput and low latency.
  *
  * Core features:
  *   - Rich command-based protocol with synchronous, asynchronous,
  *     and fire-and-forget variants.
  *   - Multiple data payload types:
  *       - Console strings (plain text / UTF-8)
  *       - DFE streams (structured binary data)
  *       - Direct (no-reply) commands for one-way messaging
  *       - Big streams (e.g., file transfers) with fragmentation
  *         and flow control
  *       - Complete buffers (atomic blocks) with optional compression
  *         and disk swapping
  *   - Built-in encryption (multiple ciphers, CBC mode, fast instance reuse)
  *   - Built-in compression (ZLib) for payloads and complete buffers
  *   - Reliable ordered packet layer (Sequence Packet model) over
  *     unreliable transports (e.g., UDP) with automatic retransmission
  *     and acknowledgment
  *   - P2P Virtual Machine (P2PVM) overlay for NAT traversal and logical
  *     tunnelling over existing connections
  *   - StableIO - persistent session layer that survives reconnections
  *   - HPC (High-Performance Computing) - thread-pool based command execution
  *     for CPU-intensive tasks without blocking the main loop
  *   - Automated P2PVM service discovery and tunnel establishment
  *   - Extensive statistics, monitoring, and debugging hooks
  *
  * ============================================================================
  * CRITICAL SUBSYSTEMS (key classes)
  * ============================================================================
  *   TPeerIO              - per-connection state machine; handles send/receive
  *                          queues, big-stream reassembly, complete-buffer
  *                          assembly, and sequence-packet reliability.
  *   TZNet                - base framework; command registration, IO management,
  *                          progress engine, P2PVM integration.
  *   TZNet_Server         - concrete server implementation; manages incoming
  *                          connections, broadcasting, and per-IO sends.
  *   TZNet_Client         - concrete client implementation; manages single
  *                          connection, synchronous/asynchronous connect, and
  *                          server state synchronisation.
  *   TZNet_P2PVM          - virtual network overlay; provides P2P connectivity
  *                          over an existing IO, with authentication, listening,
  *                          and virtual IO routing.
  *   TZNet_WithP2PVM_Server - server variant that can be exposed over P2PVM.
  *   TZNet_WithP2PVM_Client - client variant that connects over P2PVM; supports
  *                            cloning to create multiple virtual channels.
  *   TZNet_StableServer/Client - stable session layer; maintains connection
  *                               state across physical disconnections.
  *   THPC_Stream / THPC_Console etc. - task objects for thread-pool execution.
  *
  * ============================================================================
  * DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
  * ============================================================================
  *   - Asynchronous, non-blocking I/O with a single-threaded progress loop
  *     (all operations are driven by repeated calls to Progress()).
  *   - Zero-copy buffer handling where possible.
  *   - Modular architecture with clear separation between physical transport,
  *     reliable framing, command protocol, and application logic.
  *   - Extensible via callbacks (C-style, methods, anonymous/nested) and
  *     user-definable objects attached to each IO.
  *   - Secure by default - authentication, encryption, and hash verification
  *     are built into the protocol.
  *
  * ============================================================================
  * NOTES
  * ============================================================================
  *   - The framework is used in game servers, real-time data distribution,
  *     file transfer, and distributed computing systems.
  *   - It is designed to run on both FPC (Free Pascal) and Delphi, with
  *     conditionals for platform-specific features.
  *   - Many constants and defaults can be overridden at runtime via the
  *     properties of TZNet and its derivatives.
  *   - The implementation is highly performant but also memory-conscious,
  *     offering optional disk swapping for large data items.

    { ===========================================================================
      Send command methods – with and without result callbacks.
      ===========================================================================
      These methods queue a command for transmission to the remote peer.
      The command will be sent asynchronously during the next Progress() cycle.
      The caller must ensure the IO is connected before sending.

      All methods support three callback styles:
      - No suffix: fire-and-forget (no response expected).
      - M suffix: method-style callback (of object).
      - P suffix: nested or reference (anonymous) callback.
      Additionally, some methods accept custom parameters (Param1/Param2)
      that are passed back to the callback, and an optional OnFailed callback
      for timeout or error handling.

      For stream commands, the payload is a TDFE (Data Frame Exchange) which
      can contain structured binary data. For console commands, the payload
      is a string. BigStream and CompleteBuffer commands handle large data
      blocks with specialized mechanisms.

      WaitSendXXX methods block the caller until a response is received or a
      timeout occurs – use with caution as they suspend the calling thread.

      The response is delivered asynchronously via a callback. This model
      reduces latency and improves throughput for high-frequency requests.

      block the main network loop. Simply assign the OnExecute event and
      the framework will dispatch it to the thread pool.

      This registers a command that uses the TCommandCompleteBuffer_NoWait_Bridge
      interface, which provides advanced control over result sending. The handler
      can pause, resume, or cancel the response delivery, and can work with
      separate receive and send tunnels. This is the most flexible complete-buffer
      command type, supporting complex asynchronous workflows and integration
      with TCompleteBuffer_Stream_Event_Bridge and HPC execution.
      @Param Cmd: The command name.
