  ******************************************************************************
  * Z.Net.C4.pas - Cloud 4.0 (C4) Distributed Service Framework
  *
  * This unit is the core of the Cloud 4.0 framework, providing a complete
  * infrastructure for building and deploying large-scale distributed systems.
  * It sits on top of the Z.Net networking layer and leverages P2PVM
  * (Peer-to-Peer Virtual Machine) tunnels for all inter-service communication,
  * enabling seamless NAT traversal and logical network abstraction.
  *
  * The framework offers automatic service discovery via a central Dispatch
  * (DP) service, dynamic registration, load‑aware routing, and multiple
  * authentication models (NoAuth, VirtualAuth, BuiltInAuth). It supports
  * both server-side (PhysicsService) and client-side (PhysicsTunnel)
  * endpoints, and automatically manages dependent service instances through
  * dependency descriptors.
  *

  *
  * All services and clients in C4 are built as pairs (Service + Client) and
  * registered via RegisterC40() using a unique string identifier. The
  * Dispatch (DP) service aggregates service information (TC40_Info) and
  * broadcasts it to all connected clients, enabling dynamic discovery.
  *
  * Communication between services always goes through P2PVM tunnels, which
  * are established over a single physical connection. This dramatically
  * simplifies network topology, reduces port management, and makes the
  * framework suitable for both small-scale and hyperscale deployments.
  *
  * ============================ Data Flow ====================================
  *
  * 1. A PhysicsService listens on a physical port and builds dependent
  *    services (e.g., DP, UserDB, FS) as defined by the dependency string.
  * 2. A PhysicsTunnel connects to a remote PhysicsService and builds
  *    dependent clients that mirror the remote services.
  * 3. Each service publishes its TC40_Info (type, address, workload, etc.)
  *    to all Dispatch services in the network.
  * 4. Dispatch services maintain a global TC40_InfoList and propagate
  *    updates to all connected clients.
  * 5. Clients query the local InfoList to discover available services and
  *    can connect to them via GetOrCreatePhysicsTunnel, which reuses or
  *    establishes P2PVM tunnels as needed.
  * 6. All data exchanges occur over the established P2PVM double‑tunnel
  *    (separate receive/send logical channels).
  *
  * ============================ Authentication Models ========================
  *
  *   - NoAuth        : No authentication (TC40_Base_NoAuth_Service/Client)
  *   - VirtualAuth   : Callback based authentication TC40_Base_VirtualAuth_
  *   - BuiltInAuth   : Built‑in user database (TC40_Base_Service/Client)
  *
  * Each model has DataStore variants that add file‑system and key‑value
  * storage capabilities, typically backed by ZDB2 engines.
  *
  * ============================ Dependencies =================================
  *
  * This unit directly depends on:
  *   - Z.Core          : Foundation (threading, critical sections, containers)
  *   - Z.Net           : Network I/O, command protocol, P2PVM
  *   - Z.Net.DoubleTunnelIO.* : Double‑tunnel abstractions
  *   - Z.Net.DataStoreService.* : DataStore service/client bases
  *   - Z.ZDB2.*        : Persistent storage engines (for DataStore variants)
  *
  * Legacy storage libraries (Z.ZDB.Engine, Z.ZDB.ObjectData_LIB, etc.) are
  * not used directly by this core unit; they are only referenced for
  * backward compatibility with older C4 services. For new projects, all
  * storage should be based on ZDB2.
  *
  * ============================ Use Cases ====================================
  *
  *   - Building large‑scale microservices architectures with service mesh.
  *   - Deploying IoT/edge device networks with automatic failover.
  *   - Creating multi‑tenant cloud platforms with isolated service namespaces.
  *   - Developing real‑time data pipelines with dynamic load balancing.
  *   - Replacing traditional FRP/Nginx setups with programmable CPM (Cluster
  *     Port Mapping).
  *
  * The framework is designed for iterative development: new service versions
  * can be registered alongside old ones using different identifiers, allowing
  * gradual upgrades without downtime.
  *
  * ============================ Key Components ===============================
  *
  *   - TC40_PhysicsService      : Server‑side physical endpoint manager.
  *   - TC40_PhysicsTunnel       : Client‑side connection manager.
  *   - TC40_Info / TC40_InfoList: Service metadata and discovery list.
  *   - TC40_Dispatch_Service    : Central registry for service information.
  *   - TC40_Dispatch_Client     : Client that synchronizes with Dispatch.
  *   - TC40_Custom_Service/Client: Base classes for user‑defined services.
  *   - TC40_Custom_VM_Service/Client: VM‑style components for standalone use.
  *
  * Global pools (C40_PhysicsServicePool, C40_PhysicsTunnelPool, etc.)
  * manage all instances and provide easy access for diagnostics and control.
  *
  * ============================ Console Help =================================
  *
  * TC40_Console_Help provides a rich set of diagnostic commands (service info,
  * tunnel info, instance tracking, HPC thread info, ZDB2 info, etc.) that can
  * be integrated into application consoles for real‑time monitoring.
