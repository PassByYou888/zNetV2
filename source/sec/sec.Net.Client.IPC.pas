  *  Z.Net.Client.IPC – Implements a Z.Net client that uses the z_ipc library
  *  (binary message queues) for communication instead of traditional sockets.
  *
  *  ============================================================================
  *  DESIGN OVERVIEW
  *  ============================================================================
  *  This unit provides a TZNet_Client_IPC class that acts as a drop-in replacement
  *  for a network client in the Z.Net framework. It connects to a server via a
  *  named message queue (using Boost.Interprocess) and exchanges binary data
  *  through shared memory segments.
  *
  *  The client side performs the following steps:
  *    1. Connect to the server's main queue (named "<addr>-<port>").
  *    2. Create its own private response queue (unique name obtained via
  *       ipc_client_get_resp_queue_name).
  *    3. Perform a synchronous RPC call "connect" to the server, passing its
  *       response queue name. The server replies with two notification names:
  *       one for sending data buffers (FSend_Buff_CMD_Notify) and one for
  *       disconnection (FDisconnect_CMD_Notify).
  *    4. Register binary notify handlers on the client side for these two names
  *       so that it can receive data and disconnect notifications from the server.
  *    5. Create a TZNet_Client_IPC_PeerIO object that mimics a network peer
  *       interface. This object handles buffering outgoing data and sending it
  *       via IPC notifications.
  *    6. Outgoing data is buffered with a leading 4‑byte ID (the peer's ID,
  *       which is assigned by the server during handshake) and sent as a binary
  *       notification named "buff" to the server.
  *    7. Incoming data from the server arrives via the registered notify handler
  *       (IPC_Cli_Buff_Handler), which strips the ID and forwards the payload to
  *       the PeerIO's fragment processor for decoding.
  *    8. Disconnection is initiated by the server sending a notification named
  *       FDisconnect_CMD_Notify, which triggers IPC_Disconnect_Handler.
  *
  *  ============================================================================
  *  UNDERLYING MECHANISM (z_ipc)
  *  ============================================================================
  *  - All communication is binary‑only.
  *  - Large data is transferred via shared memory segments: the sender creates a
  *    temporary shared memory object, writes the payload, and sends a control
  *    message (a small string) containing the shared memory name over the message
  *    queue. The receiver opens the shared memory, reads the data, and removes it.
  *  - The main queue is used for control messages (small strings). Each client
  *    has a dedicated response queue for replies and server‑originated notifications.
  *  - Binary RPC calls (CallBinary) are synchronous and wait for a reply. They are
  *    used only for the initial handshake.
  *  - Notifications (NotifyBinary) are asynchronous fire‑and‑forget messages,
  *    used for all subsequent data exchange.
  *
  *  This unit integrates the low‑level IPC into the Z.Net framework, providing
  *  a familiar API for application developers.

  { * TZNet_Client_IPC_PeerIO – Emulates a network peer using IPC notifications.
    * This class is a TPeerIO descendant that handles outgoing data buffering
    * and writing. It overrides the Write_IO_Buffer and related methods to send
    * data via binary notifications. It also maintains a temporary buffer
    * (FTempBuff) where outgoing data is accumulated before being flushed.
    *
    * Each instance corresponds to a logical connection (peer) managed by the
    * TZNet_Client_IPC object. Since the client only has one connection, there
    * is only one PeerIO instance.
    *
    * @Usage:
    *   This class is created internally by TZNet_Client_IPC during Connect.
    *   It is not intended to be used directly.

  { * TZNet_Client_IPC – IPC‑based client for Z.Net.
    * This class implements the TZNet_Client interface, providing Connect,
    * Disconnect, Connected, and ClientIO methods. It manages the IPC client
    * lifecycle and the handshake with the server.
    *
    * The Connect method:
    * - Creates a TIPCClient (from Z.IPC.Helper) and connects to the server's
    *   main queue.
    * - Calls the server's RPC handler "connect" via CallBinary, passing its
    *   response queue name. The server replies with two notification names
    *   (for data and disconnect) and a server‑assigned ID.
    * - Registers binary notify handlers on the client side for these names.
    * - Creates the PeerIO instance and sets its ID to the server‑assigned ID.
    * - Triggers the connect‑finished event.
    *
    * The Disconnect method sends a 'close' notification to the server and cleans up.
    * The Progress method is called periodically to process any pending events.
    *
    * @Usage:
    *   var Client: TZNet_Client_IPC;
    *   begin
    *     Client := TZNet_Client_IPC.Create;
    *     try
    *       if Client.Connect('my_server', 0) then
    *       begin
    *         // Connection established, use Client.ClientIO to send/receive data
    *       end;
    *     finally
    *       Client.Free;
